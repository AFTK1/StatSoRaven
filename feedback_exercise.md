Team we Partnered With: What a Save! - Dallon Haley & Tyler Allen

*Feedback that we were given 

General Questions:

    Are the objectives interesting to the target audience? 
        - It definitely would be something that a fan of any team in particular would enjoy for their 
        favorite team. 

    Is the scope of the project appropriate? If not, suggest improvements.
        - It is appropriate, no complaints for this. 

    Is the split between optional and must-have features appropriate? Why?
        - They are mostly appropriate. The only thing we'd suggest is to include transitions in the
        must-have section instead of the optional section.

    Is the visualization innovative? Creative? Why?
        - It is creative. Even though there are a lot of visualizations that exist already for sports
        in general, having one for a specific team would be cool and distinctive from others. 
        
    Does the visualization scale to the used dataset? Could it handle larger but similar datasets? 
        - Yes, it scales to the dataset they plan to use just fine. It shouldn't have an issue handling
        a similar but larger dataset as well. 

    Is the project plan detailed enough? Is a path to the final project clear?
        - Yes, the plan is detailed enough. It is fairly straightforward.  

    Is an interesting story told?
        - Yes, as we were saying above, this would definitely be interesting for the target audience
        depending on what team it is for. 

Visual Encoding:

    Does the visualization follow the principles used in class? 
        - Yes, it follows them. 

    What is the primary visual encoding? Does it match to the most important aspect of the data?
        - Their primary visual encoding are the charts they use to display their stats. It matches
        the most important aspect of the data. 

    What other visual variables are used? Are they effective?
        - N/A - we are not sure what this is asking.

    Is color sensibly used? If not, suggest improvements.
        - Yes, their color choices seem fine and not convoluted. 

Interaction and Animation:

    Is the interaction meaningful? If not, suggest improvements.
        - They did not really mention much about having interaction. One thing we'd suggest is to 
        animate the lines being drawn for line graphs and having the bars shrink or grow as well
        for their bar chart. 

    If multiple views, are they coordinated? If not, would it be meaningful?
        - Yes, they are coordinated. It makes sense the way they want to do it. 

    Is there any animation planned? Is it clear? Is it intuitive? 
        - No, they did not mention anything about animation besides having transitions included in 
        their optional features. 

How we will address the feedback:

    The feedback we were given was useful. We didn't realize that going over interactions and animation
    was required. We figured that we would just add it later after we have our visualizations up and
    running. We plan on doing exactly what was suggested for us, and maybe adding anything else we can 
    think of on the way while working on the project. The TA also gave us some feedback. The thing he 
    suggested is that for the optional features, we mentioned using other teams as well. But the TA said 
    that we can ignore that and focus more on the visualization rather than gathering more data, so we plan
    to follow that too.
